# 🛰️ Hermes Crypto Radar — Enterprise Audit (v1.4.0)

> **Date:** 2026-07-04
> **Version Audited:** v1.4.0 (marketplace-ready, enterprise polished)
> **Scope:** Full codebase, architecture, testing, documentation, data pipeline, plugin integration, security, marketplace readiness
> **Target Grade:** Enterprise 10/10
> **Grading Methodology:** Section-by-section objective scoring against production-grade software standards. This is an **absolute, zero-bias** assessment — not relative to MVP or "good for OSS." Every category rated against what a shipping enterprise product would need.

---

## Executive Summary

```
Current Enterprise Score: 9.4/10
Target:                  10/10
Gap:                     0.6/10
```

Major improvement since v1.3.0 (+0.7). Key wins: marketplace readiness checklist completed, documentation audit coverage expanded to include marketplace readiness, TypeDoc configuration fully enterprise-spec, TypeScript strict-mode hardening turned on, and all configuration files brought to enterprise standards. Remaining gaps now cluster in minor automation features (auto-dynamic default, parallel strategy eval). The plugin is marketplace-ready with Hermes marketplace checklist fully verified.
